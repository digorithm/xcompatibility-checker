/*
 Analyzer is a tool to check both the overall cross-browser compatibility of github projects
 as well as their historical cross-browser compatibility net-worth, i.e. if their compatibility
 increases or decreases overtime.

 Usage:
 - Go to your terminal, move to the root folder, run `node git_analysis/analyzer.js`
